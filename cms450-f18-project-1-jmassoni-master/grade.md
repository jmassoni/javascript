All programs look good and produce correct output.

It works, but I'm pretty uncomfortable with the use of labeled goto statements in the primes program. It does allow you to continue to
inner or outer while loops, but it's generally considered a bad idea to use labeled jumps. A better overall strategy is to write your
code in a way that removes the need for jumps.

Other than that, good work!
